And miles to go before I sleep!
And miles to go before I sleep,
But I have promises to keep,
The house are lovely, dark and deep,
Of easy wind and downy flake!
The only other sound’s the sweep
To ask if there is some mistake!
He gives his harness bells a shake
The darkest evening of the year!
Between the house and frozen lake
To stop without a farmhouse near
My little horse must think it queer
To watch his house fill up with snow!
He will not see me stopping here
His house is in the village though;
Whose house these are I think I know!
By Robert Frost
Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening
 
 I love this poem because of its soothing melody and brilliant rhyme scheme. 
 Notice how (in the original poem) the third line of each stanza rhymes with the first, second, and fourth of the next stanza. It is a work of genius.

 I changed woods to house and the periods to exclamation points.
